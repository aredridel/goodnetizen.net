So you want to contribute.

The short way: Create a new directory with a markdown file in it inside of `contents/articles/`. Make yourself an `author.json` -- feel free to use mine as an example. Send me a pull request. I'll make sure it looks good before I throw it live.

The long way: The site is built with [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) -- clone the repository and run `npm install`. Edit and build with `npm run build`. Feel free to send pull requests!
